  <p class="lead">
    Bootstrap 3 was released over a decade ago in August 2013, and Bootstrap 4
    over six years ago in January 2018. Since then, millions of people have
    learned Bootstrap, prototyped with it, and shipped some amazing sites and
    apps with it. While Bootstrap 5 is continuing that journey with developers
    all over the world, there are still tons of those teams living on an older
    version of Bootstrap with limited to no support. Until now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bootstrap 3 reached end of life July 24, 2019, followed by Bootstrap 4 on
    January 1, 2023. As such, neither version receives new features, updates, or
    security fixes. However, both are still available on all existing
    distribution channels (CDNs, package managers, GitHub, etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    We strongly recommend folks start out on or
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/">upgrade</a> to the
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">latest version of Bootstrap (v5.x)</a>
    , but for those who can't upgrade just yet and have compliance or security
    requirements, we're introducing

  <h2>What's Next</h2>

  <p>
    Bootstrap 5 has been the default version of Bootstrap since May 5, 2021.
    Users who have migrated have enjoyed:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Dependency on jQuery</strong></li>

    Bootstrap 5 completely removes jQuery as a dependency, opting instead for
    vanilla JavaScript. This change was aimed at improving performance, reducing
    project file sizes, and catering to modern development environments where
    jQuery is less prevalent.

    <li><strong>Enhanced Grid System</strong></li>

    Bootstrap 5 further enhances the grid system with additional utility classes
    and improved customization options, making it even easier to create complex
    layouts. It also introduces the use of CSS custom properties (variables) for
    more dynamic styling.

    <li><strong>Improved Customization</strong></li>

    Bootstrap 5 focuses heavily on custom properties (CSS variables), which are
    easier to use and allow for real-time theme customization without the need
    to recompile Sass. This makes theme customization far more accessible and
    dynamic.

    <li><strong>Updated Components and Utilities</strong></li>
    Bootstrap 5 introduces new components (such as offcanvas menu for better
    mobile experiences) and updated existing components with new features and
    improved accessibility. It also expands Bootstraps utility API for spacing,
    typography, and color, providing more control over the design directly from
    the class attributes.

    <li><strong>Improved Accessibility</strong></li>
    Accessibility has been a focus of Bootstrap, with each version making
    strides in ensuring web content is accessible to all users. Bootstrap 5
    emphasizes improvements in form controls, color contrast ratios, and
    keyboard navigation to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
    standards more closely.

    <li><strong>Enhanced Performance and Best Practices</strong></li>
    By removing jQuery and making other optimizations, Bootstrap 5 aims to
    improve loading times and performance for websites and applications. Version
    5 also embraces best practices for responsive design, encouraging a more
    mobile-first approach to layouts and interactions.

    <li><strong>Native Dark Mode Support</strong></li>
    While not initially released with Bootstrap 5, subsequent updates have
    focused on native dark mode and custom color mode support, reflecting a
    growing trend in user interface design preferences.

    <li><strong>…and more!</strong></li>
    When and if you can, consider migrating!
  </ul>

  <h2>Still on Bootstrap 3 or 4?</h2>

  <p>
    We know that some folks aren't able to upgrade or fully migrate for one
    reason or another, so here are some other options to consider. Update to the
    Bootstrap 3 or 4 Final Release (v3.4.1 / v4.6.2)
  </p>

  <p>
    The latest release of Bootstrap 3 (v3.4.1) and Bootstrap 4 (v4.6.2) were the
    final releases of these major versions and included security patches for XSS
    vulnerabilities (v3.x), bug fixes for enhanced stability, and updated
    documentation for better developer guidance.
  </p>

  <p>
    These versions will be the starting point for extended support mentioned
    below.
  </p>

  <h2>Purchase Extended Support for Bootstrap 3 and 4</h2>

  <p>
    If you have to stay on Bootstrap 3 and 4 post-EOL, we have partnered with
    HeroDevs to offer Never-Ending Support (NES). NES for Bootstrap 3 and 4
    provides ongoing updates and security patches for both versions even after
    EOL so that applications with strict compliance requirements remain secure
    and compliant. It also guarantees that Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4
    applications will continue to operate effectively in modern browsers and
    maintain compatibility with essential libraries. Finally, Bootstrap NES has
    continuous security monitoring and a 14-day SLA for fixes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bootstrap NES is the continuation of the support you've enjoyed during the
    Bootstrap 3/4 LTS periods—but indefinitely. For more detailed information,

  <h2>Notify Your Users of your Bootstrap 3/4 Post-EOL Plan</h2>

  <p>
    If you can't migrate to Bootstrap 5 or use Bootstrap NES at the moment but
    still remain on Bootstrap 3 or 4, you may need to consider how you will
    communicate your security plans to your customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not apply to all Bootstrap users, but many teams are prohibited
    from shipping unsupported software by SLAs, contracts and agreements, or
    other obligations to downstream parties. These could be with customers,
    compliance agencies, or even internal company departments. For an increasing
    number of industries, governing regulatory bodies are also raising
    expectations on what software creators are accountable for.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you work with such business requirements, You may need to let your
    customers, managers, CIO/CISO, or other relevant stakeholders know about
    your plan to manage, support and address any potential CVEs.

    <a href="https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/bootstrap"
      >While Bootstrap 3 and 4 haven't had any major vulnerabilities</a
    >
    that have not received patches in later versions, CVEs do turn up for even
    the most mature EOL projects—whether directly or via compromised
    dependencies. Subscribing to CVE notifications through organizations like
    <a href="https://www.opencve.io/welcome">OpenCVE</a>
    and <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> can be a good way to find out about
    vulnerabilities as soon as they're discovered. Browsers may also ship
    changes that break legacy libraries—this is rare, but it does happen.
