  <h2 id="third-box-sizing">Box-sizing</h2>
  <p>Some third party software, including Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine, conflict with Bootstrap's usage of <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>, a rule which makes it so <code>padding</code> does not affect the final computed width of an element. Learn more about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/">box model and sizing at CSS Tricks</a>.</p>
  <p>Bootstrap is making all the elements inherit the <code>box-sizing</code> property from their parents. So you only need to set <code>.component { box-sizing: content-box; }</code> to make your <code>content-box</code> component work.
