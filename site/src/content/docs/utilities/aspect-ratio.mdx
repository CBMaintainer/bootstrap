title: Aspect Ratio
description: Use generated pseudo elements to make an element maintain the aspect ratio of your choosing. Perfect for responsively handling video or slideshow embeds based on the width of the parent.

Use the ratio utility to manage the aspect ratios of content like `<iframe>`s, `<embed>`s, `<video>`s, and `<object>`s. These helpers also can be used on any standard HTML child element (e.g., a `<div>` or `<img>`). Customize the available aspect ratios with the Sass variable or the utility API.

**Pro-Tip!** You don't need `frameborder="0"` on your `<iframe>`s as we override that for you in [Reboot]([[docsref:/content/reboot]]).

## Example

Add your ratio utility to the element you want to modify, like an `<iframe>`. Ratio utilities also pair well with any width utilities, as shown below.

<Example code={`<iframe class="w-100 ratio-16x9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpOULjyy-n8?rel=0" title="YouTube video" allowfullscreen></iframe>`} />

## Aspect ratios

Aspect ratios can be customized with modifier classes. By default the following ratio classes are provided:

<Example class="bd-example-ratios" code={`<div class="ratio-auto">
  <div>Auto</div>
</div>
<div class="w-25 ratio-1x1">
  <div>1x1</div>
</div>
<div class="w-50 ratio-4x3">
  <div>4x3</div>
</div>
<div class="w-75 ratio-16x9">
  <div>16x9</div>
</div>
<div class="w-100 ratio-21x9">
  <div>21x9</div>
</div>`} />

## Custom ratios

## Sass map

Within `_variables.scss`, you can change the aspect ratios you want to use. Here's our default `$aspect-ratios` map. Modify the map as you like and recompile your Sass to put them to use.
