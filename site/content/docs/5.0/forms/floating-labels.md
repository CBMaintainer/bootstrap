## Example

Wrap a pair of `<input class="form-control">` and `<label>` elements in `.form-floating` to enable floating labels with Bootstrap's textual form fields. A `placeholder` is required on each `<input>` as our method of CSS-only floating labels uses the `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-element. Also note that the `<input>` must come first so we can utilize a sibling selector (e.g., `~`).

This approach works in the new Microsoft Edge built on Chromium and gracefully degrades on older versions.

{{< example >}}
<div class="form-floating mb-3">
  <input type="email" class="form-control" id="floatingInput" placeholder="name@example.com">
  <label for="floatingInput">Email address</label>
</div>
<div class="form-floating mb-3">
  <input type="password" class="form-control" id="floatingPassword" placeholder="Password">
  <label for="floatingPassword">Password</label>
</div>
{{< /example >}}
